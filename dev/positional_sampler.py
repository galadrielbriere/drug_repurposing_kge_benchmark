    """Positional negative sampler as presented in 2011 paper by Socher et al..
    Either the head or the tail of a triplet is replaced by another entity
    chosen among entities that have already appeared at the same place in a
    triplet (involving the same relation). It is not clear in the paper how the
    choice of head/tail is done. We chose to use Bernoulli sampling as in 2014
    paper by Wang et al. as we believe it serves the same purpose as the
    original paper. This class inherits from the
    :class:`torchkge.sampling.BernouilliNegativeSampler` class
    seen as an interface. It then has its attributes as well.
